# Test BrineFluidProperties calculations of enthalpy
#
# It is difficult to compare with experimental data, so instead we recreate
# the data presented in Figure 11 of Driesner, "The system H2o-NaCl. Part II:
# Correlations for molar volume, enthalpy, and isobaric heat capacity from
# 0 to 1000 C, 1 to 500 bar, and 0 to 1 Xnacl", Geochimica et Cosmochimica
# Acta 71, 4902-4919 (2007).
#
# Pressure = 100 bar (10 Mpa)
# Temperature = 300 C (573.15 K)
# NaCl mole fraction from 0 to 0.15 (mass fraction from 0 to 0.364)
